# Hilo
How good is your guess? Play Hilo and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. You start with 300 points. Look at your card and guess if the next card will be a higher number or a lower number. If you guess right you earn 100 points. If you guess wrong you lose 75 points.  If you lose all of your points the game is over. If you have more than zero points you can always choose to keep playing! Will you try your luck?
